# Don't forget to surround abstract with double quotes
abstract: "As part of the ReScience Ten Years Reproducibility Challenge, I sought to reproduce the
    analyses in Bond-Lamberty et al. (2009). The R program file for this paper was available, 
    although it was unpublished and undocumented, but a full output file from the original analysis
    was available. The results were essentially reproduced, with one or two minor changes in 
    e.g. the sixth decimal place of a few numbers. The original choice to use only
    base R functions imposed limitations but also enhanced reproducibility, given that software's
    historical emphasis on backward compatibility."
