              Canadian boreal forest",

              Ewers, Brent E",
  abstract = "Changes in fire regimes are driving the carbon balance of much of
              the North American boreal forest, but few studies have examined
              fire-driven changes in evapotranspiration (ET) at a regional
              scale. This study used a version of the Biome-BGC process model
              with dynamic and competing vegetation types, and explicit spatial
              representation of a large (106 km2) region, to simulate the
              effects of wildfire on ET and its components from 1948 to 2005 by
              comparing the fire dynamics of the 1948--1967 period with those
              of 1968--2005. Simulated ET averaged, over the entire temporal
              and spatial modeling domain, 323 mm yr−1; simulation results
              indicated that changes in fire in recent decades decreased
              regional ET by 1.4\% over the entire simulation, and by 3.9\% in
              the last ten years (1996--2005). Conifers dominated the
              transpiration (EC) flux (120 mm yr−1) but decreased by 18\%
              relative to deciduous broadleaf trees in the last part of the
              20th century, when increased fire resulted in increased soil
              evaporation, lower canopy evaporation, lower EC and a younger and
              more deciduous forest. Well- and poorly-drained areas had similar
              rates of evaporation from the canopy and soil, but EC was twice
              as high in the well-drained areas. Mosses comprised a significant
              part of the evaporative flux to the atmosphere (22 mm yr−1).
              Modeled annual ET was correlated with net primary production, but
              not with temperature or precipitation; ET and its components were
              consistent with previous field and modeling studies. Wildfire is
              driving significant changes in hydrological processes by
              affecting mean stand age, forest species and energy balance.
              These changes, particularly in poorly-drained areas, may control
              the future carbon balance of the boreal forest.",

@ARTICLE{Bond-Lamberty2007-uq,
  title    = "Fire as the dominant driver of central Canadian boreal forest
              carbon balance",
  author   = "Bond-Lamberty, Ben and Peckham, Scott D and Ahl, Douglas E and
              Gower, Stith T",
  abstract = "Changes in climate, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and
              fire regimes have been occurring for decades in the global boreal
              forest, with future climate change likely to increase fire
              frequency--the primary disturbance agent in most boreal forests.
              Previous attempts to assess quantitatively the effect of changing
              environmental conditions on the net boreal forest carbon balance
              have not taken into account the competition between different
              vegetation types on a large scale. Here we use a process model
              with three competing vascular and non-vascular vegetation types
              to examine the effects of climate, carbon dioxide concentrations
              and fire disturbance on net biome production, net primary
              production and vegetation dominance in 100 Mha of Canadian boreal
              forest. We find that the carbon balance of this region was driven
              by changes in fire disturbance from 1948 to 2005. Climate changes
              affected the variability, but not the mean, of the landscape
              carbon balance, with precipitation exerting a more significant
              effect than temperature. We show that more frequent and larger
              fires in the late twentieth century resulted in deciduous trees
              and mosses increasing production at the expense of coniferous
              trees. Our model did not however exhibit the increases in total
              forest net primary production that have been inferred from
              satellite data. We find that poor soil drainage decreased the
              variability of the landscape carbon balance, which suggests that
              increased climate and hydrological changes have the potential to
              affect disproportionately the carbon dynamics of these areas.
              Overall, we conclude that direct ecophysiological changes
              resulting from global climate change have not yet been felt in
              this large boreal region. Variations in the landscape carbon
              balance and vegetation dominance have so far been driven largely
              by increases in fire frequency.",
